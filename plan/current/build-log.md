<!-- Copy and fill in this block at each phase boundary. Headings use the form
     "### P<n>: {Phase Name}" with n from 1 to 4 and the phase names
     P1: Plan, P2: Implement, P3: Validate and Accept, P4: Ship.

### P<n>: {Phase Name}

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Start | `2026-11-07T21:30:12Z` |
| End | `pending` |
| Wall clock | `pending` |
| Model tier | primary |
| Skills loaded | `{{skill names}}` |
| Agents spawned | `0` |
| MCP calls | `0` |
| Parallel task batches | `0` |
| Notes | `Run mode: autonomous. Run speed: standard.` |

<!-- Skipped phase. A phase with no block needs a line "Skipped: P<n> ({reason})".
     Ship runs ravintio-zero/scripts/build-log-check.mjs, which fails a missing
     block that has no such line.
-->

<!-- Progress markers. Each dispatched unit adds these lines under its phase
     block, per "Progress Markers and Interrupted Units" in
     ravintio-zero/standards/agent-dispatch-standards.md:

- In progress: {unit} ({ISO-8601 timestamp})
- Done: {unit} ({ISO-8601 timestamp})
- Resumed after interruption: {unit} rerun, {stash note}
